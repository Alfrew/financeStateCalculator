# FsCalculator

## Description

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.3.

App inspired by the Stephen Antonioni's Net Worth Table spreadsheet. <br/>
I've decided to create this app mainly to improve the mobile user experience, since the spreadsheet one mobile has a pretty bad UX. <br/>
Other than that I've also decided to work on this project to create a personal workflow and start to build a personal How to and Wiki to support future app development. <br/>
During the development I've learned how to localize an Angular app, improved my Angular Material knowledge and designing skills

## Usage

- Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
